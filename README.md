# EcoDispose API for find collection points for environmentally sensitive materials. 
Be ecologically sustainable!.

The EcoDispose API is a web and mobile backend solution for an application that supports community members who want to dispose of environmentally sensitive products sustainably and correctly.

It manages records of collection points, materials, notifications, and receiving entities, and demonstrates how to configure and run the application and database on the Railway cloud platform. Build updates and deployments are automated with the platformâ€™s integration with GitHub.

For example, when the repository receives updates, the cloud service automatically generates a new build based on the configuration and can run the application automatically.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonasfschuh/EcoDisposeAPI.git
```

2. Install dependencies with Maven

## Local-usage

1. Start the application with Maven
2. The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
3. The H2 Database will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
with H2 Database credentials: user: admin password: admin 

## Cloud-usage

1. Create a railway account https://railway.app/, and
2. Create a Postgres database.
3. Set the environment variables of API on IntelliJ as generated by the Postgres container on railway.
4. Logged into railway, configure the integration with github to generate continuous integration and delivery.
5. Create a service in railway. When deploying, the application will build and start the application automatically.

Notes: This service allows you to configure a domain to expose this service and make it accessible outside the container.

6. Below is an example generated in my configuration to access swagger-ui.
